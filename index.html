                     Daniel was born and raised in San Diego, CA. From an early age he showed interest in computers.  Daniel curiosity for learning led him to  learn about different topics online.  One of this topics was business.  Daniel learned to open and run an e-commerse store online.  However, one day he relize that he wanted to learn how all these pages he was using to do product research , keyword , reasearch, were developed.  I went on the internet, watched some videos, and then I went on some tutorial sites.  That day I realized that web development was something I could do forever.  There was always something to learn, to fix, or to make better.
